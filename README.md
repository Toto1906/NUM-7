# Num Project number 7

Two version of this were made:
- Non-optimized: a classic version with normal matrices, a full plate, and the discretization shown in the course
- Optimized: a version using a quarter of a plate, special memory effective solutions, and an extra boundary condition for the edges of the quarter plate

To run a single non-optimized simulation, use the function plot_simple() from the script simple_non_optimized.py, and modify the wanted parameters at the begining of the script. 
To run a single optimized, run the 

To run multiple non-optimized simulations, run the script multiple_non_optimized.py, and modify the variable N_ for the amount of simulations wanted.
To run multiple optimized simulations, run the script main_optimized.py, and change the variables N_max and coarser for the amount of simulations wanted.
